This was a capstone project for my highschool Procedural Programming class. The purpose of the project was to provide clarity for students experiencing major indecision prior to college. 
The program recommends a major based on the results of a RIASEC test. The letters in the acronym correspond to six personality types that are used to match individuals to a career. 
In this program, three personality types are assigned to each major in the .csv file. 

There is another feature that allows the user to input an SAT score. The program matches the scores to a major in .csv file based on real data from the College Board.
